A bold and experiential sculpture, the art forms a nexus between the river and downtown Nashville. The sculpture takes advantage of the dynamic views from many nearby vantage points, and its reflectivity and color make it interactive and always changing throughout the day and night. Conceptually, the artwork draws on the city’s relationship to the river, symbolically reuniting the city’s past and present as well as the natural and urban environment of downtown. The form of the sculpture is based on the meandering curves of the Cumberland River as it passes through Davidson County. The very top of the sculpture, pointing toward the sky, includes stainless steel textile of reflective metal guitar picks. The picks also hang from the underside of the sculpture where they create a subtle musical sound when there is a breeze. On the top portion of the city-facing side of the sculpture, color changing LED strip lights illuminate a series of horizontally inset acrylic rods, creating a textured ribbon of electric light at night. The lighting draws from the changing colors and qualities of light on the river.
